<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->

## About The Project

[![Product Name Screen Shot][product-screenshot]](https://hester-by-pawanjs.netlify.app/)

**This project is under development.**

Hester is a E-commerce website for a pickle selling business. The aim of the website is to provide a platform for selling products. A user can sign up and sign in his account. I am using stripe as payment platform. The site is using gatsby and uses modern JavaScript tools, such as Webpack to bundle the modules, and Babel to convert ES6, ES7 and ES8 back to ES5.

### Built With

This app is built with Gatsby with react and JavaScript along with HTML and SCSS. It uses webpack as module bundler and NPM as package manager.
